Masterless SaltStack Minion with Salty Vagrant
==============================================

Before You Begin
================

All of this was tried on *Ubuntu 12.10*.  There's an expectation that the 
package names may change between different distributions.  Our goal is to 
install the bare minimum through packages, and have the newest versions of both 
vagrant & salty vagrant from their respective online repos.

We'll need the following to continue:
	* Virtualbox (I'm using 4.2.10)
	* ruby gem
	* Salt Stack 
	* salty-vagrant
	* A text editor of your choice.
