Masterless SaltStack Minion with Salty Vagrant
==============================================

Before You Begin
================

All of this was tried on *Ubuntu Desktop 12.10*.  There's an expectation that 
the package names may change between different distributions.  Our goal is to 
install the bare minimum through packages, and have the newest versions of both 
vagrant & salty vagrant from their respective online repos.

We'll need the following to continue:
	* `Virtualbox <http://virtualbox.org>`_ (I'm using 4.2.10)
	* ruby gem 
	* `Salt Stack <http://saltstack.org>`_ 
	* `salty vagrant <https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant>`_
      * salty vagrant `installation instructions <https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant#masterless-quick-start>`_
	* A text editor of your choice. `Like this one <http://sublimetext.com>`_

Now repeat after me:
Salt Stack is amazing!  It's simply Python & YAML & Jinja2 (oh my!).  All 
magic within Salt Stack may be unlocked by reading the documentation.

Installing All the Goodies
==========================

Recap:  this is all done on *Ubuntu Desktop 12.10*.  I have every bit of faith 
that this will function on any other setup so long as you have Virtualbox and 
Ruby with a little bit of Python magic.

    # Dirty Ruby business 

    # Our OS's pkg manager will handle Gem
    $ sudo apt-get install gem

    # gem will handle getting the latest vagrant & salty-vagrant
    $ sudo gem install vagrant

Now you should know I could tell you how to install salty-vagrant, but following 
the easy to read instructions would be beneficial to everyone involved:

salty vagrant `installation instructions <https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant#masterless-quick-start>`_

#. Install Vagrant
#. Install Salty Vagrant (``vagrant plugin install vagrant-salt``)
#. Get the Ubuntu 12.04 base box: ``vagrant box add precise64 http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box``
#. Create/Update your ``Vagrantfile`` `(Detailed in Configuration) <https://github.com/saltstack/salty-vagrant#configuration>`_
#. Place your minion config in salt/minion [1]
Run vagrant up and you should be good to go.
